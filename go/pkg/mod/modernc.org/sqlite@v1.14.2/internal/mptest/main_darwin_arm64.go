//
// Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
// [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
// [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
// This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
// against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
//
// If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
// may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
// only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
// is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to NULL.
//
// The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
// [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
// The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
// flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
// and not its inode needs to be synced.
//
// The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
// </ul>
// xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
// The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
// either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
// PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
// if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
//
// The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
// VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
// [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
// integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
// point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
// write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
// functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
// locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
// about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
// core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
// A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
// Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
// greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
// return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
// recognize.
//
// The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
// device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
// minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
// other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
// method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
// underlying device:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]

// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC]
// </ul>
//
// The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
// any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
// mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and

// first then the size of the file is extended, never the other

// If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to

// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random

//
// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
// </ul>
//
// The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be

//
// ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction

// be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
// It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
// for exclusive access.
//
// ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
// to hold the [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third

// allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
// the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either

// this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
// element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
// or failure of the xOpen call.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
// ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
// to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
// test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
// to test whether a file is at least readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
// flag is never actually used and is not implemented in the built-in
// VFSes of SQLite.  The file is named by the second argument and can be a
// directory. The xAccess method returns [SQLITE_OK] on success or some
// non-zero error code if there is an I/O error or if the name of
// the file given in the second argument is illegal.  If SQLITE_OK
// is returned, then non-zero or zero is written into *pResOut to indicate
// whether or not the file is accessible.
//
// ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
// output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
// is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
// is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
// handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
// to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
//
// The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
// interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
// included in the VFS structure for completeness.
// The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
// of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
// the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
// The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
// least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
// method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
// a floating point value.
// ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian

// a 24-hour day).
// ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current

// ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.

// though this is not guaranteed. ^The
// first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must

// second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage
// associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
// a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
// extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
// database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
// on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
// ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
// created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
// false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
// does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
// it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
// never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
// ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
// false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
// ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
// never contain any unpinned pages.
//
// [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
// ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the

//
// ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
// register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an
// instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
// In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by
// SQLite is used for the page cache.
// By implementing a
// custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
// the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which
// that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to
// determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for
// how long.
//
// The alternative page cache mechanism is an
// extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
// The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
//
// ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an

// The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures

// built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
// page cache.)^

// so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
// xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does

//
// _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
// code as compact as possible.
//
// _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
// than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
// that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
// _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
// _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.

//
//   They must have "the same type as would an expression that is an
//   object of the corresponding type converted according to the integer
//   promotion".

// 7.18.2.1 Limits of exact-width integer types

//
//       Note:  the literal "most negative int" cannot be written in C --
//       the rules in the standard (section 6.4.4.1 in C99) will give it
//       an unsigned type, so INT32_MIN (and the most negative member of
//       any larger signed type) must be written via a constant expression.
//

// 7.18.2.2 Limits of minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.3 Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.4 Limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers

// 7.18.2.5 Limits of greatest-width integer types

// 7.18.3 "Other"

// WCHAR_MIN should be 0 if wchar_t is an unsigned type and
//    (-WCHAR_MAX-1) if wchar_t is a signed type.  Unfortunately,
//    it turns out that -fshort-wchar changes the signedness of
//    the type.

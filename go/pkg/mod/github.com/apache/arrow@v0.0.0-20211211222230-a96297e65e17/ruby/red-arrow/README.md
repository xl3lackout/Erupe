# Red Arrow - Apache Arrow Ruby

Red Arrow is the Ruby bindings of Apache Arrow. Red Arrow is based on GObject Introspection.

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is an in-memory columnar data store. It's used by many products for data analytics.

[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a middleware for language bindings of C library. GObject Introspection can generate language bindings automatically at runtime.

Red Arrow uses [Apache Arrow GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib) and [gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection) to generate Ruby bindings of Apache Arrow.

Apache Arrow GLib is a C wrapper for [Apache Arrow C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp). GObject Introspection can't use Apache Arrow C++ directly. Apache Arrow GLib is a bridge between Apache Arrow C++ and GObject Introspection.

gobject-introspection gem is a Ruby bindings of GObject Introspection. Red Arrow uses GObject Introspection via gobject-introspection gem.

## Install

Install Apache Arrow GLib before install Red Arrow. See [Apache Arrow install document](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) for details.

Install Red Arrow after you install Apache Arrow GLib:

```console
% gem install red-arrow
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "arrow"

table = Arrow::Table.load("/dev/shm/data.arrow")
# Process data in table
table.save("/dev/shm/data-processed.arrow")
```

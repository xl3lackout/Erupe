New Contributor's Guide
***********************

This guide is meant to be a resource for contributing to
`Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org>`_ for new contributors.

No matter what your current skills are, you can try and make
your first time contribution to Arrow.

Starting to contribute to a project like Apache Arrow can be
intimidating. Taking small steps will make this task
easier.


Why contribute to Arrow?
========================
There can be various reasons why you might want to contribute
to Arrow:

* You find the project interesting and would like to try making
  a contribution to learn more about the library and grow your skills.

* You use Arrow in a project you are working on and you would like
  to implement a new feature or fix a bug you encountered.

Read more about the project in the :ref:`architectural_overview` section.

Quick Reference
===============

Here are the basic steps needed to get set up and contribute to Arrow.
This is meant both as a checklist and also to provide an overall picture of the process.

For complete instructions please follow :ref:`step_by_step` (a
step-by-step guide) or R and Python :ref:`tutorial-index` for an example
of adding a basic feature.


#. **Install and set up Git, and fork the Arrow repository**

   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`set-up` Git and fork the
   Arrow repository.

#. **Build Arrow**

   Arrow libraries include a wide range of functionalities and may require
   the installation of third-party packages, depending on which build
   options and components you enable. The C++ build guide
   has suggestions for for commonly encountered issues - you can find it
   :ref:`here <cpp-development>`. 
   Anytime you are stuck, feel free to reach out via
   appropriate :ref:`communication` channel.

   See a short description about the building process of 
   :ref:`PyArrow or the R package<build-arrow>` or go straight to detailed
   instructions on how to build one of Arrow libraries in the
   `documentation <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/>`_ .
 
#. **Run the tests**
   
   Run the tests from a terminal for Python

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pytest pyarrow

   or in R console for R

   .. code-block:: R

      devtools::test()

   See also the section on :ref:`testing`.

#. **Find an issue (if needed), create a new branch and work on the problem**

   **Finding an issue**

   You might already have a bug to fix in mind, or a new feature that you want to implement. But if you
   don't and you need an issue to work on, then you may need help finding it. Read
   through the :ref:`finding-issues`  section to get some ideas.

   **Finding your way through the project**

   The first step when starting a new project is the hardest and so we've wrote some guides to help you with this.

   .. TODO: Read through :ref:`solving`  section.

   **Communication**

   Communication is very important. You may need some help solving problems
   you encounter on the way (this happens to developers all the time). Also,
   if you have a JIRA issue you want to solve, then it is advisable to let the team
   know you are working on it and may need some help.

   See possible channels of :ref:`communication`.

#. **Once you implemented the planned fix or feature, write and run tests for it**

   See detailed instructions on how to :ref:`test <testing>`.

#. **Push the branch on your fork and create a Pull Request**

   See detailed instructions on :ref:`pr_and_github`


If you are ready you can start with building Arrow or choose to follow tutorials
on writing an R or Python test.

**We want to encourage everyone to contribute to Arrow!**

Arrow Flight
============

.. ifconfig:: not flight_enabled

   .. error::
      This documentation was built without Flight enabled.  The Flight
      API docs are not available.

.. NOTE We still generate those API docs (with empty docstrings)
.. when Flight is disabled and `pyarrow.flight` mocked (see conf.py).
.. Otherwise we'd get autodoc warnings, see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4770

.. warning:: Flight is currently unstable. APIs are subject to change,
             though we don't expect drastic changes.

.. This section should include extra description to the

.. add: How to run one test, test file or all the tests
.. together and why is it good to do that.
.. What if the unconnected tests start failing? etc.

In this section we outline steps needed for unit testing in Arrow.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Pytest

      We use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for
      unit tests in Python. For more info about the required
      packages follow
      :ref:`Python unit testing section <python-unit-testing>`.

      To run a specific unit test, use this command in 
      the terminal from the ``arrow/python`` folder:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py -k test_your_unit_test

      Run all the tests from one file:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py

      Run all the tests:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow

      If the tests start failing, try to recompile
      PyArrow or C++.
      
      .. note::

         **Recompiling Cython**

         If you only make changes to `.py` files, you do not need to
         recompile PyArrow. However, you should recompile it if you make
         changes in `.pyx` or `.pxd` files.
        
         To do that run this command again:

         .. code:: console

            $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

      .. note::
		
         **Recompiling C++**

         Similarly, you will need to recompile the C++ code if you have
         made changes to any C++ files. In this case,
         re-run the cmake commands again.

Arrow Flight RPC
================

.. note:: Flight is currently unstable. APIs are subject to change,
          though we don't expect drastic changes.

Error Handling
==============

Error handling uses the normal :class:`arrow::Status` class, combined
with a custom :class:`arrow::StatusDetail` object for Flight-specific
error codes.

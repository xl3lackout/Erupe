# Do nothing. This exists only for not requiring qemu-aarch64-static copy.
# Recent Debian (buster or later) and Ubuntu (18.10 or later) on amd64 hosts or
# arm64 host don't require qemu-aarch64-static in Docker image. But old Debian
# and Ubuntu hosts on amd64 require qemu-aarch64-static in Docker image.
#
# We use "COPY qemu* /usr/bin/" in Dockerfile. If we don't put any "qemnu*",
# the "COPY" is failed. It means that we always require "qemu*" even if we
# use recent Debian/Ubuntu or arm64 host. If we have this dummy "qemu*" file,
# the "COPY" isn't failed. It means that we can copy "qemu*" only when we
# need.
#
# See also "script" in dev/tasks/linux-packages/azure.linux.arm64.yml.
# Azure Pipelines uses old Ubuntu (18.04).
# So we need to put "qemu-aarch64-static" into this directory.

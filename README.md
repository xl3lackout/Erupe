# Erupe Community Reupload
 This is a community upload of a community project. The amount of people who worked on it is innumerous, and hard to keep track of. But id like to contribute this to the efforts of Ando, Fists Team, the French Team, Mai's Team and the many wondeful members of the MHFZ community who gave their time and energy to help us. No matter the relations, these files will remain public and open source, free for all to use and modify. 


A pastebin for general overview, tips, and FAQ: https://pastebin.com/QqAwZSTC

An upload for the quest and scenario files will be here: https://github.com/xl3lackout/MHFZ-Quest-Files
(itll take a while its like 300k+ files)

Client Files (Game Files) if you need them:

1fichier: https://1fichier.com/?51066bxpv20gpicf780r
1fichier is very fast and doesn't have a quota, but if your download fails you have to wait two hours. Rather spartan.
 
Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REYFX6JNANmKR07XaY6yWzucQMc-u-mq/view
Google Drive is reliable, but there's sometimes an inexplicable quota when too many people download it. Honestly your best choice for pretty much anything since you can also make a copy of the files to your own Drive.
 
Anonfiles: https://anonfiles.com/Jf135bG0x2/Erupe_-_Community_Edition_zip
Anonfiles is middle-of-the-road speed, but the download will always stay up no matter how many times it's been downloaded by others. A bit untrustworthy but that's just the nature of anonymity.

# Erupe Community Reupload
 This is a community upload of a community project. The amount of people who worked on it is innumerous, and hard to keep track of. But id like to contribute this to the efforts of Ando, Fists Team, the French Team, Mai's Team and the many wondeful members of the MHFZ community who gave their time and energy to help us. No matter the relations, these files will remain public and open source, free for all to use and modify. 


A pastebin for general overview, tips, and FAQ: https://pastebin.com/QqAwZSTC

An upload for the quest and scenario files will be here: https://github.com/xl3lackout/MHFZ-Quest-Files
(itll take a while its like 300k+ files)

We should be getting an upload for client files if you don't already have your hands on them, but it cant be handled through github, ill post the link here.
